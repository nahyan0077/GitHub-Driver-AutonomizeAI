## Installation

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nahyan0077/GitHub-Driver-AutonomizeAI.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend/
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Backend

4. **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The server will start running on **port 3000** by default.

## API Endpoints

Below are the routes you can interact with once the server is running:

### 1. Create or Fetch GitHub User Data

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/github/create-user/:username`
- **Description:** Fetches user data from GitHub based on the username. If the user does not exist in the database, it fetches the data from GitHub and saves it to the database.

### 2. Get Users

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/github/get-users`
- **Description:** Retrieves a list of all users stored in the database.

### 3. Delete User

- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/github/delete-user/:id`
- **Description:** Soft deletes a user from the database based on the user ID.

## Deployment

Access the deployed backend application using the link below:

## Usage

Once the backend server is running, you can interact with it using HTTP requests as described in the API Endpoints section.
